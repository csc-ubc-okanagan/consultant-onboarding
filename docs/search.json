    "text": "Consultations & Academic / Scholarly Integrity\nIt is important to be cognizant of when help begins to infringe on academic and scholarly integrity. This is all the more difficult as different supervisors, collaborators, and disciplines have differing expectations on the scope of support that is legitimate. In some cases, it may be appropriate to write code for an analysis, so long as attribution is provided. In other cases, it may be unacceptable for the student to use code drafted by someone else. The former may be the case if the purpose of the required understanding is the conceptual approach and output; the latter if the required understanding includes a level of mastery of the language.\nIt is importnat to communicate during a consultation that the student should engage with their collaborators and supervisor on the level of support that they are getting; an effective way of doing this is to ask them to solicit feedback on a proposed solution or path forward followed by booking another consultation when things are agreed upon by the research team (possibly just the student and their supervisor).\nBecause writing and trouble shooting code can be a very hands on activity, we have the following guide to help limit the level of ‘authoring’ the data consultant engages in and how much of the original data any authoring happens on:\n\n\n\nActivity\nLocation\n\n\n\n\ntrouble shoot code\non their machine, full data set\n\n\nwrite code\non their machine, using a sample\n\n\ntroubleshoot a model\non their machine, full data set\n\n\nwrite / customize a model\non their machine, using a sample\n\n\ninterpret findings\non their machine, full data set\n\n\n\n\nHandling Substantive Contributions\nIn spite of being aware and taking precautions, you may well end up in a situation feeling like you’re making ‘substantive’ contributions to the student’s project. In such cases you should always make your supervisor aware of the situation.\nExamples of how these situations might be navigated include:\n\nWhen ‘substantive’ contributions are being made to overcome a lack of understanding on the user’s part (this is in contrast to a ‘substantive’ contribution whose primary purpose is demonstration). In these cases, the student should be referred to their supervisor for guidance and may be referred to other self-guided resources or workshops.\nWhen ‘substantive’ makes you think your contributions warrant acknowledgement. In these cases, the student should be made aware of this fact.\nWhen ‘substantive’ makes you think your contributions warrant co-authorship. You should be thinking about this before we get to this stage. If acknowledgment is veering toward co-authorship, this should be clarified with the student and the conversation should include other co-authors and consent from the PI. Your manager / supervisor should also be alerted. If work does veer in this direction, it as the discretion of the consultant to pursue this collaboration outside of their data consultant role."

    "text": "Preparing for the consultation\nWhen booking a consultation, students will be asked if they will be bringing code and / or data to the consultation. If they answer yes, you are to create a folder for them, titled with their name, and invite them to it, asking them to deposit any materials at least 24 hours in advance of the consultation.\nYou will need to request access yourself to the data-deposit/ directory, if you don’t already have access. You can do so by clicking on this link.\nConsultations are booked in one hour slots. Time management is very important, and it’s important to reasonably limit the scope of what can be covered in a single consultation, encouraging students to book follow up appointments. It is also advisable, when doing time management with a consultation, to aim for 45 minutes, giving yourseld a 15 minute buffer.\nThis being said, each one hour consultation could easily take 2 hours of your time, especially if this is the first time the student is booking. It is expected that you will take some time to review any deposited code, data, and associated documentation in advance of the consultation. It is also expected that you will take some time responding post consultation via email to the student, summarizing what was covered in the session and what you’ve agreed on for next steps.\nIt is also expected that you may need to do spend some time investigating or researching novel concepts that arise during a consultation to effectively support a student. If you find yourself requiring more than an hour in such follow up research, bring this to the attention of your supervisor for discussion on how best to approach balancing what might become competing interests on having time for consultations, time for preparation and follow up, and time for skills and knowledge development."
