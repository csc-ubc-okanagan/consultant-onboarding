Encourage them to attend CSC workshops offered throughout the semester, such as Working with R in the first semester and Statistical Fundamentals + Modelling in the second semester. Also, many online resources are available and should be recommended during workshop sessions. Relevant blog posts on the CSC website should be introduced and presented to clients as helpful learning tools.\nDepending on the nature of their questions, whether they are about visualization or analysis, you can offer general guidance, such as appropriate types of visualizations or potential statistical tests based on their research questions. However, providing detailed and tailored advice typically requires some foundational statistical knowledge, which the client may not yet have in the first session. In such cases, encourage them to return for follow-up sessions, where more precise and specific guidance can be offered once they have a stronger understanding.\nYou should not write entire scripts for clients, as this is outside the scope of our data consultation services. If clients request a full script, please note that this is not within the scope of our services, but you would be happy to help them troubleshoot or use the proper approach to their own written code.\nYou may encounter clients who are working with other statistical tools such as SPSS or STATA/MP and are seeking guidance on their analysis. While you can offer general advice on data analysis approaches, you may not be able to provide hands-on support with these specific software programs, depending on your own expertise and experience. It is recommended to communicate and clarify this with the client before the session so they have a clear understanding of what kind of support they can expect."

These situations might require you to explore the problem further on your own and follow up with the client afterward.\nFor example, a client might be working with data where the outcome variable is continuous, not normally distributed, and includes true zeros and positive values (not necessarily counts). This restricts the use of many commonly applied distributions in standard modeling approaches. In such scenarios, the Tweedie distribution is often recommended, as it can accommodate both zero values and positive continuous outcomes in the same model."

    "text": "Consultations & Academic / Scholarly Integrity\nIt is important to be cognizant of when help begins to infringe on academic and scholarly integrity. This is all the more difficult as different supervisors, collaborators, and disciplines have differing expectations on the scope of support that is legitimate. In some cases, it may be appropriate to write code for an analysis, so long as attribution is provided. In other cases, it may be unacceptable for the student to use code drafted by someone else. The former may be the case if the purpose of the required understanding is the conceptual approach and output; the latter if the required understanding includes a level of mastery of the language.\nIt is importnat to communicate during a consultation that the student should engage with their collaborators and supervisor on the level of support that they are getting; an effective way of doing this is to ask them to solicit feedback on a proposed solution or path forward followed by booking another consultation when things are agreed upon by the research team (possibly just the student and their supervisor).\nBecause writing and trouble shooting code can be a very hands on activity, we have the following guide to help limit the level of ‘authoring’ the data consultant engages in and how much of the original data any authoring happens on:\n\n\n\nActivity\nLocation\n\n\n\n\ntrouble shoot code\non their machine, full data set\n\n\nwrite code\non their machine, using a sample\n\n\ntroubleshoot a model\non their machine, full data set\n\n\nwrite / customize a model\non their machine, using a sample\n\n\ninterpret findings\non their machine, full data set\n\n\n\n\nHandling Substantive Contributions\nIn spite of being aware and taking precautions, you may well end up in a situation feeling like you’re making ‘substantive’ contributions to the student’s project. In such cases you should always make your supervisor aware of the situation.\nExamples of how these situations might be navigated include:\n\nWhen ‘substantive’ contributions are being made to overcome a lack of understanding on the user’s part (this is in contrast to a ‘substantive’ contribution whose primary purpose is demonstration). In these cases, the student should be referred to their supervisor for guidance and may be referred to other self-guided resources or workshops.\nWhen ‘substantive’ makes you think your contributions warrant acknowledgement. In these cases, the student should be made aware of this fact.\nWhen ‘substantive’ makes you think your contributions warrant co-authorship. You should be thinking about this before we get to this stage. If acknowledgment is veering toward co-authorship, this should be clarified with the student and the conversation should include other co-authors and consent from the PI. Your manager / supervisor should also be alerted. If work does veer in this direction, it as the discretion of the consultant to pursue this collaboration outside of their data consultant role."

If they answer yes, you are to create a folder for them, titled with their name, and invite them to it, asking them to deposit any materials at least 24 hours in advance of the consultation.\nYou will need to request access yourself to the data-deposit/ directory, if you don’t already have access. You can do so by clicking on this link.\nConsultations are booked in one hour slots. Time management is very important, and it’s important to reasonably limit the scope of what can be covered in a single consultation, encouraging students to book follow up appointments. It is also advisable, when doing time management with a consultation, to aim for 45 minutes, giving yourseld a 15 minute buffer.\nThis being said, each one hour consultation could easily take 2 hours of your time, especially if this is the first time the student is booking. It is expected that you will take some time to review any deposited code, data, and associated documentation in advance of the consultation. It is also expected that you will take some time responding post consultation via email to the student, summarizing what was covered in the session and what you’ve agreed on for next steps.\nIt is also expected that you may need to do spend some time investigating or researching novel concepts that arise during a consultation to effectively support a student. If you find yourself requiring more than an hour in such follow up research, bring this to the attention of your supervisor for discussion on how best to approach balancing what might become competing interests on having time for consultations, time for preparation and follow up, and time for skills and knowledge development."
