<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="service-model">Service Model</h2>
<p>There are some common scenarios that may occur during your consultation sessions. Below are suggestions on how to handle them effectively:</p>
</section>
<section id="individual-arrives-with-no-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-with-no-data">Individual arrives with no data:</h2>
<p>This should be more common than it is. We encourage students to consult at a minimum at three stages during their project: a) prior to data collection; b) post data collection; c) during analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Research Question and Hypotheses</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, it is critical to emphasize the need for a robust, clearly articulated research question and robust, clearly articulated hypotheses. If these cannot be clearly articulated by the student, provide examples, articulate the relevance to statistical analysis, and encourage them to cement these with their supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection Plan</strong></p>
<p>Discuss their data collection plan and help to address if it appears to violate standard assumptions. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a random sample?</li>
<li>Is there pseudo replication?</li>
<li>What sample size is sufficient?</li>
<li>Is there a risk of missing data or nonresponse bias?</li>
<li>Directing to Resources</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="individual-arrives-with-limited-ability-to-describe-their-data-and-research-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-with-limited-ability-to-describe-their-data-and-research-questions">Individual arrives with limited ability to describe their data and research questions:</h2>
<p>We want to ensure the student understands how their data relate to their research question and can comfortably describe their data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You should begin by assessing whether the student can clearly articulate their research question. This is a critical stage because it’s been noticed that some students are given already collected data and cannot make a valid question based on it. So if they struggle, explain the importance of a well-defined research question for valid statistical analysis. Highlight that defining it post hoc may introduce limitations but offer to help in refining it if they wish to proceed.</p></li>
<li><p>You should also explore whether the student can articulate their hypothesis, including a null and alternative hypothesis. If not, you can help them in formulating these, noting any limitations of post hoc hypothesis development, but support them in moving forward if desired.</p></li>
<li><p>You should evaluate the student’s ability to describe their data, including how it was collected, the type of data, the measures used, and the independent and dependent variables. If they cannot provide this information, walk them through the process of describing their data, possibly suggesting the creation of a data dictionary to organize this information. You should emphasize that understanding the data is essential before selecting a statistical test.</p></li>
<li><p>If the student can describe their data and research question adequately, you may proceed to discuss potential statistical approaches or tests that align with their objectives.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="individual-arrives-with-a-dataset-asking-for-support-in-conducting-a-particular-statistical-test-of-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-with-a-dataset-asking-for-support-in-conducting-a-particular-statistical-test-of-the-data">Individual arrives with a dataset asking for support in conducting a particular statistical test of the data:</h2>
<p>We want to ensure that the chosen test is appropriate for the data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start by identifying the assumptions of the proposed statistical test. Discuss these with the student to ensure they understand what conditions must be met for the test to be valid.</p></li>
<li><p>Check whether the student has tested these assumptions. If they have, review the results to confirm the test’s suitability. If not, help them with how to conduct assumption tests, offering to demonstrate or explain the process as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess whether any assumptions of the test are violated. If no violations are found, evaluate whether the dataset is large enough for the test results to be meaningful. If the dataset is too small, you should communicate the limitations and discuss whether proceeding with the test is appropriate for their project.</p></li>
<li><p>If assumptions are violated, explore whether an alternative test could be suitable for their data. If a viable alternative exists, introduce it and explain its advantages. If no alternative is appropriate or the student prefers to use the original test despite violations, clearly communicate the limitations but assist in demonstrating the test and interpreting its results.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We want to ensure the student understands how their data relate to specific tests, how then to implement these tests and finally, interpret the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the student with options as appropriate, providing guidance if they request it. Demonstrate how to test for assumptions in the test(s), how to implement the test(s), and how to interpret the results.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="individual-arrives-with-no-background-in-coding-or-statistical-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-with-no-background-in-coding-or-statistical-analysis">Individual arrives with no background in coding or statistical analysis:</h2>
<p>You may encounter clients who have no experience with coding in R or Python and limited or no understanding of statistical analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since our service focuses on using R and Python, it is important to suggest that these clients begin learning the basics of these tools. Encourage them to attend CSC workshops offered throughout the semester, such as Working with R in the first semester and Statistical Fundamentals + Modelling in the second semester. Also, many online resources are available and should be recommended during workshop sessions. Relevant blog posts on the CSC website should be introduced and presented to clients as helpful learning tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the nature of their questions, whether they are about visualization or analysis, you can offer general guidance, such as appropriate types of visualizations or potential statistical tests based on their research questions. However, providing detailed and tailored advice typically requires some foundational statistical knowledge, which the client may not yet have in the first session. In such cases, encourage them to return for follow-up sessions, where more precise and specific guidance can be offered once they have a stronger understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>You should not write entire scripts for clients, as this is outside the scope of our data consultation services. If clients request a full script, please note that this is not within the scope of our services, but you would be happy to help them troubleshoot or use the proper approach to their own written code.</p></li>
<li><p>You may encounter clients who are working with other statistical tools such as SPSS or STATA/MP and are seeking guidance on their analysis. While you can offer general advice on data analysis approaches, you may not be able to provide hands-on support with these specific software programs, depending on your own expertise and experience. It is recommended to communicate and clarify this with the client before the session so they have a clear understanding of what kind of support they can expect.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="individual-arrives-experiencing-difficulties-with-their-coding" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-experiencing-difficulties-with-their-coding">Individual arrives experiencing difficulties with their coding:</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you may have clients who are moderately proficient in coding but are facing issues in their scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is often seen in clients who are trying to model their data or who have used AI-generated codes without fully understanding their purpose. In such cases, it is recommended that you first gain a full understanding of their dataset and research question. The imported data should be explored to ensure there are no issues with the data itself. More tailored help can be provided once you understand the specific error they are encountering.</p></li>
<li><p>You may quickly develop an idea of what kind of code and analysis would be suitable after seeing their data and research questions. If it becomes clear that the client is using uncommon packages or methods, it is a good idea to introduce them to more standard or widely accepted approaches for analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that you are not expected to be familiar with every potential error in R or Python. Sometimes, identifying the root cause takes time. In such situations, you can work with a sample dataset provided by the client on your own machine after the session and follow up with them once you have resolved or identified the issue.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="individual-arrives-working-with-less-common-types-of-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-working-with-less-common-types-of-data">Individual arrives working with less common types of data:</h2>
<p>You may encounter clients who are working with unusual or less common types of data as part of their thesis or course project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In such cases, it may not be possible to provide precise guidance during the session due to the complexity or uncommon structure of their data. These situations might require you to explore the problem further on your own and follow up with the client afterward.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, a client might be working with data where the outcome variable is continuous, not normally distributed, and includes true zeros and positive values (not necessarily counts). This restricts the use of many commonly applied distributions in standard modeling approaches. In such scenarios, the <a href="https://r.qcbs.ca/workshop06/book-en/other-distributions.html">Tweedie distribution</a> is often recommended, as it can accommodate both zero values and positive continuous outcomes in the same model.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-arrives-seeking-support-for-non-data-related-questions">Individual arrives seeking support for non-data-related questions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some clients may seek our services for help with their research proposals or presentations, especially when discussing the statistical analysis section of their methodology. In some cases, you might notice that their writing needs significant improvement. When this happens, it is helpful to recommend that they also take advantage of other services offered by CSC, such as writing consultations.</li>
