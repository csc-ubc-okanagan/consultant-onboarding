## Service Model

Blog posts should help address common, repeat questions from students that are easily generalizeable. As much as possible, they should be concise and focused on a very specific task.

You are encouraged to update old posts and draft new content.

## Creating Posts

We use Blogdown to write and release content hosted on GitHub pages. The CSC Data Blog repository, along with instructions for drafting, building, and pushing content can be found at [https://github.com/csc-ubc-okanagan/csc-data-blog](https://github.com/csc-ubc-okanagan/csc-data-blog).

You are encouraged to actively contribute to the site's documentation if you identify gaps, to address updates, errors, etc.

The blog can be accessed at [https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/csc-data-blog/](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/csc-data-blog/).
